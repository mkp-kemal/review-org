            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Posted on August 10, 2025 by the CurveballCritiques Team</p>
            <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/3B82F6/FFFFFF?text=Red+Flags" alt="Red flags on a baseball field" class="rounded-xl my-8">
            
            <p>Choosing a travel baseball team is one of the most important decisions a family can make. More than the team's record or the tournaments they attend, the coach will have the biggest impact on your child's development, confidence, and love for the game. A great coach can be a life-changing mentor; a bad one can lead to burnout and frustration.</p>
            <p>As you evaluate programs, it's crucial to look beyond the sales pitch and observe how a coach operates. Here are five critical red flags to watch out for.</p>
            
            <h2>1. The "Win-at-All-Costs" Mentality</h2>
            <p>This is the most common and damaging red flag. This coach prioritizes winning a weekend tournament over long-term player development. You'll see them throwing their best pitcher for too many innings, benching developing players in close games, and creating a high-pressure environment where mistakes are punished instead of used as teaching moments.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Poor Communication</h2>
            <p>A good coach communicates clearly and respectfully with both players and parents. A red flag is a coach who is disorganized, rarely provides feedback, or is dismissive of parents' questions. Look for a coach who has a clear philosophy and is willing to discuss your child's role on the team and areas for improvement.</p>

            <h2>3. Lack of Focus on Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>Travel ball often involves more games than practices. While games are fun, true skill development happens through repetition and fundamental work. A red flag is a program with very few practices, or practices that are disorganized and don't focus on core skills like fielding, throwing mechanics, and hitting technique.</p>

            <h2>4. Unequal Treatment or Favoritism</h2>
            <p>It's natural for a coach to have a core group of top players, but every player on the roster deserves the opportunity to develop and contribute. Watch out for coaches who consistently play the same nine players while others rarely leave the bench, especially at younger age levels. This not only stunts development but also destroys team morale.</p>

            <h2>5. Disregard for Player Safety</h2>
            <p>This is a non-negotiable red flag. A coach who ignores pitch count limits, fails to monitor players for signs of fatigue or injury, or encourages players to "play through" pain is putting your child at serious risk. A great coach understands that these are young, developing bodies and prioritizes their long-term health above all else.</p>
